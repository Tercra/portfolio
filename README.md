# Tools
  - React
  - Material UI + Material UI Icons
  - Font Awesome (added to html)
  - Devicon (added to html)
 
 ## Notes/Reflections
  - The components are a bit messy, because there are a mix of material ui and a mix of plain html + CSS
  - Try to not use Material UI next time since it splits apart the CSS all over the place
  - Also made the mistake of using icons from three different places unecessarily.
    - Could have just narrowed it down to two. (Devicon + another) for my purposes.
  - Objectively sucks at design
    
## Learning Points
  - Playing around in CSS and learning more about it
    - Grids and Flex displays are very useful, should learn more about them.
  - Learned more about how to use themes in Material UI
  - Learned about how to use icons
  - condition ? code if true : code if false
  - Optional Chaining (?.)
  - index.js in a folder (and the exports from that js file) allows other files to import from the folder location instead of having seperate lines of code for each import file.

  - "lightPeach" - `#fbbbad`




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
